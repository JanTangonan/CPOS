Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up SSL
Step 1: Install OpenSSL
If you don't have OpenSSL installed, you can download and install it from openssl.org. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Step 2: Generate a Self-Signed Certificate
Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to your project directory.

Run the following command to generate a self-signed certificate:

Follow the prompts to fill in the certificate details. You can use default values or customize them as needed. The important fields are:

Common Name (CN): This should be the hostname you will use to access your app (e.g., localhost or your local IP address).
This command will generate two files: server.key (private key) and server.cert (certificate).

Step 3: Configure Create React App to Use HTTPS
Create a .env file in the root of your project if it doesn't already exist.

Add the following environment variables to the .env file:

Step 4: Start the Development Server
Start your development server using npm start. Create React App will use the self-signed certificate to serve your app over HTTPS.
Step 5: Access the App on Your iPhone
Find your local IP address. You can do this by running ipconfig on Windows or ifconfig on macOS/Linux in the terminal.

Access your app from your iPhone using the local IP address and the port number (e.g., https://192.168.1.100:3000).

Step 6: Trust the Self-Signed Certificate on Your iPhone
To avoid security warnings, you need to trust the self-signed certificate on your iPhone:

Transfer the Certificate to Your iPhone:

Email the server.cert file to yourself or use a file-sharing service to transfer it to your iPhone.
Install the Certificate:

Open the email or file-sharing app on your iPhone and tap on the server.cert file.
Follow the prompts to install the certificate.
Trust the Certificate:

Go to Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings.
Enable full trust for the installed certificate.
